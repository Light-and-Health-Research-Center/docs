## Add custom source

The CS Calculator 2.0 can perform calculations with its pre-built sources, as well as with custom user-inputted sources. To add a custom source:

1. Click on the **Add Custom Source** icon in the **Source List** panel.

   <Img
     src="/img/docs/cscalc/usage/advanced-usage/add-source-icon.png"
     alt="add source icon"
     width={859}
     height={448}
   />

2. The **Add Custom Source** modal will appear.

   <Img
     src="/img/docs/cscalc/usage/advanced-usage/add-custom-source-modal.png"
     alt="add custom source modal"
     width={812}
     height={815}
   />

3. Fill in the **Source Name**, **Manufacturer**, **CCT/Color**, **Lamp Type**, **Description**, and **SPD** input fields.
 
  <AlertBox color="blue">
    <b>Tip:</b> Only the Source Name and SPD fields are required. The other
    fields are only used for filtering and organization.
  </AlertBox>

  The **Source Name** field:

    - Must be unique from any of the other sources.

  The **SPD** field:

    - Will accept relative or absolute SPDs, and convert them automatically to relative.
    - Will accept any range of wavelengths, but will ultimately cut off anything outside the range $0nm \leq wavelength \leq 730nm$.
    - Will accept any wavelength step size.
    - Must contain at least three data points.
    - Must contain the same number of wavelengths and values.

  If any of these criteria are not met, the **Add Source** button will be disabled.

  <AlertBox><b>Tip:</b> Use the <b>Toggle SPD Input Type</b> button to be able to enter in wavelengths and values in seperate text boxes. 
    <Img
      src="/img/docs/cscalc/usage/advanced-usage/toggle-spd-input-type.png"
      alt="toggle spd input type button"
      width={783}
      height={270}
    />
  </AlertBox>

## Download custom sources as JSON

Your custom sources can be downloaded so you can avoid having to input them every time you revisit the site.

1. Click the **Download Custom Sources as JSON** icon in the **Source List** panel.
  <Img
    src="/img/docs/cscalc/usage/advanced-usage/download-sources-as-json.png"
    alt="download custom sources as JSON"
    width={707}
    height={448}
  />

2. Save the file from the download window that pops up.
    <AlertBox><b>Tip:</b> This popup window might look slightly different depending on the browser you are using.</AlertBox>
      <Img
        src="/img/docs/cscalc/usage/advanced-usage/download-sources-popup.png"
        alt="download custom sources as JSON download popup window"
        width={451}
        height={339}
      />

      Here is an example of the structure of the resulting file. This is an example of a JSON file containing **two** sources: a warm source, and a cool source.

      ```json
      {
        "sources": [
          {
            "id": "Warm Source",
            "manufacturer": "N/A",
            "cct": "4000 K",
            "lamp": "N/A",
            "info": "4000 K CCT, Warm circadian response source.",
            "spd": {
              "wavelength": [...],
              "value": [...]
            },
            "custom": "true"
          },
          {
            "id": "Cool Source",
            "manufacturer": "N/A",
            "cct": "6500 K",
            "lamp": "N/A",
            "info": "6500 K, cool response source.",
            "spd": {
              "wavelength": [...],
              "value": [...] 
            },
            "custom": "true"
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

      <AlertBox><b>Tip:</b> If the resulting <b>Source</b> object in the downloaded JSON file is empty, check to make sure you've added one or more custom sources.</AlertBox>

## Upload custom sources from JSON

Once you've downloaded your custom sources as JSON, you can upload those sources back into the calculator without the hassle of manual input.

1. Click the **Upload Custom Sources from JSON** icon in the **Source List** panel.
  <Img
    src="/img/docs/cscalc/usage/advanced-usage/upload-sources-as-json.png"
    alt="upload custom sources as JSON icon"
    width={853}
    height={450}
  />

2. An **Upload Custom Sources from JSON** modal will appear, click **Browse...** and select the JSON sources you wish to upload.
  <AlertBox><b>Tip:</b> You can select and upload any number of JSON files at one time.</AlertBox>
  <AlertBox color="yellow"><b>Warning:</b> Sources must have a unique id. If two or more of the sources you wish to upload share the same id, they will be ignored.</AlertBox>
  <Img
    src="/img/docs/cscalc/usage/advanced-usage/upload-custom-sources-as-json-modal.png"
    alt="upload custom sources as JSON modal"
    width={517}
    height={252}
  />

3. Once you've selected the JSON files you wish to upload, click the **Upload Sources** button.
  <Img
    src="/img/docs/cscalc/usage/advanced-usage/upload-sources-button.png"
    alt="upload sources button"
    width={513}
    height={252}
  />

4. If the files you uploaded are valid, you will see your custom sources appear in the **Source List** panel and they will automatically be added to the **Selected Sources** panel in the Calculations pane.
  <Img
    src="/img/docs/cscalc/usage/advanced-usage/uploaded-sources-added-to-selected-sources.png"
    alt="uploaded sources added to selected sources panel"
    width={856}
    height={194}
  />

## Edit a Custom Source

Editing a custom source from within the CS Calculator 2.0 can be helpful so you don't have to upload an entirely new source everytime you want to make a change.

1. Click the **Edit Source** icon that appears in the **Source List** panel next to all custom sources.
  <Img
    src="/img/docs/cscalc/usage/advanced-usage/edit-source-icon.png"
    alt="edit source icon"
    width={855}
    height={449}
  />

2. Adjust any input fields in the **Edit Custom Source** modal that appear and click **Edit Source**. These input fields are the same as when <DocLink href="#add-custom-source">adding a custom source</DocLink>.
  <Img
    src="/img/docs/cscalc/usage/advanced-usage/edit-source-modal.png"
    alt="edit source modal"
    width={816}
    height={815}
  />

## Download metrics as text

Downloading the combined output metrics as text can be helpful in translating them into your own work, such as copy and pasting them into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.

1. Click the **Download Metrics as Text** icon in the **Metrics** panel.
  <Img
    src="/img/docs/cscalc/usage/advanced-usage/download-metrics-as-text-icon.png"
    alt="download metrics as text icon"
    width={851}
    height={640}
  />

2. Save the file from the download window that pops up.
  <AlertBox><b>Tip:</b> This popup window might look slightly different depending on the browser you are using.</AlertBox>
  <Img
    src="/img/docs/cscalc/usage/advanced-usage/download-metrics-popup.png"
    alt="download metrics popup"
    width={447}
    height={333}
  />

  Here is an example of the structure of the resulting file.

  ```textile

  <AlertBox color="yellow"><b>Warning:</b> Because of the way the web outputs this text content, it will not copy/paste nicely into Microsoft Excel; the resulting file from the download will, however.</AlertBox>

## Download combined SPDs as text

Downloading the combined SPDs as text can be helpful in translating them into your own work, such as copy and pasting them into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.

1. Click the **Download Combined SPDs as Text** icon in the **Combined Source SPDs** panel.
  <Img
    src="/img/docs/cscalc/usage/advanced-usage/download-combined-spds-as-text-icon.png"
    alt="download combined spds as text icon"
    width={858}
    height={760}
  />

2. Choose whether to **Download Relative SPD** or **Download Absolute SPD** from the dropdown.

## Download all calculations as JSON

Should you want to experiment with the CS Calculator 2.0 data in your own programmatic work, you can download all the calculation data into a single JSON file.

1. Click the **Download All Calculations as JSON** icon in the **Calculations** tab.
  <Img
    src="/img/docs/cscalc/usage/advanced-usage/download-all-calculations-as-json-icon.png"
    alt="download all calculations as json icon"
    width={918}
